myfiles
=======

Here is the collection of my dotfiles (VIM, tmux, and git).

VIM
---

Plugins that I use :

* [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* [vim-commentary (tpope)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)

I wrote the little script usemyvimconfig.sh. Go in the directory called vimfiles then run it if you want to use my VIM configuration.
