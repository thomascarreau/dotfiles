myfiles
=======

Here is the collection of my dotfiles (vim, tmux, and git) and a gnuplot template. Even if I use plugins daily, there is no plugins here because of portability.

Plugins that I use :

* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [vim-commentary (tpope)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* [vim-repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat)
* [vim-mdformatting (inspired by christoomey)](https://github.com/thomascarreau/vim-markdown)
