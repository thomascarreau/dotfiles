Plugins that I use :

* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

I wrote the little script `usemyvimconfig.sh`. Go in the directory called vimfiles then run it if you want to use my VIM configuration.
