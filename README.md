myfiles
=======

Here is the collection of my dotfiles (vim, tmux, and git) and a gnuplot template. No plugins because of portability.

Plugins that I use daily :

* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [vim-commentary (tpope)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* [vim-markdown (inspired by Chris Toomey)](https://github.com/thomascarreau/vim-markdown)
