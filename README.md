myfiles
=======

Here is the collection of my dotfiles (vim, tmux, and git) and a gnuplot template.

VIM

Plugins that I use :

* [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* [vim-commentary (tpope)](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

I wrote the little script usemyvimconfig.sh. Go in the directory called vimfiles then run it.
